Heap Algorithm
It is used to implement priority queue
Priority queue 
It is used in heap sort basically priority queue is a type when something which we wnat in the order of priority

Binary heap is fo two type 
Min heap-- highest is assigned lowest value
max heap-Highest priority is assigned highest value

A binary heap is a complete binary tree 
complete binary tree is a tree in which the heap is filled completely but last level is not filled 
We want to store binary heap as array 
and it should start from left and end at right and last level can have no child 
we can represent it in array without any space
left=2i+1
right=2i+2
parent(i)=(i-1)//2


example to understand this 
[1,2,3,4,5,,6,7,8]
left of 1 is 2(position)
where as right of 1 is 3(position)
parent of 3 is = 1(position)

This formula can give left child right child and parent

Advantages 
Random Access
complete binary tree so height of tree is completely used 
Heap operation depend on height of tree


Min Heap
Min heap is completely binary tree the root/descendent should have lowest value
                 10
                 / \
                20  15
               /\   / \
              30 40 18 19   
Min heap is presented as array it is pictorial representation

Decrease and Delete operation  
                 10                      
                 / \
                20  40
               /\   / 
            80 100 70    
                  |
                  |
                  5
                 / \
               10   40
               /\     \
              30 100   70  

so in this basically we have been give i=3 and x=5 i is index that we have to change and so after changing the index min heap 
property will be violated so we have to reassble the min heap
